# Introduction

Pacman is an open-source game written using Python 3. It features the classical Pacman game, a yellow munching ball crawling around to eat fruits while 4 ghosts, namely: Blinky (red ghost), Pinky (pink ghost), Inky (blue ghost), Clyde (orange ghost), are chasing after him.

# Dependencies
* Python 3.8
* Turtle Module
* Winsound

# Future development
* Find and implement a better way to create the walls
* Improve fruit generating and consuming algorithm
* Add multi-OS support as it's optimized for Windows only for now
* Additional levels, in case the wall and fruit mechanism is improved
* Sound when moving the player and fix multiple sound plays as it's troublesome now
